# Landing Plan: Safety and Performance

This document lists the work that remains before the shared-memory threads
work (`THREAD.md`) can land on `main`. Two questions decide whether it lands:

1. **Safety.** Does it work, with the flag off, with the GIL on, and with the
   GIL off?
2. **Performance.** Does ordinary single-threaded code get slower when the
   flag is off?

Each section below says what is known today, what is missing, and what
"done" means.

## Current state

The branch `sosuke/threads` is the squashed threads work (oven-sh/WebKit#249),
rebased onto `main` at `491b5cc236e9`, plus the review fixes from
oven-sh/WebKit#549 and the fixes the rebase needed.

All results below come from one configuration: Linux x86-64, Debug, ASAN,
`-DPORT=JSCOnly`, the `build.ts` flags. Nothing has been measured in Release,
under TSAN, on macOS, on arm64, on Windows, or inside Bun.

| Suite | Mode | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `Tools/threads/run-tests.sh` | GIL on (`--useJSThreads=1`) | 153 pass, 0 fail, 2 skip |
| `Tools/threads/run-tests.sh` | GIL off (see below) | 148 pass, 4 fail, 3 skip |
| `Tools/threads/run-tests.sh --cve` | GIL on | 46 pass, 19 fail |
| `Tools/threads/run-tests.sh --cve` | GIL off | 58 pass, 4 fail, 3 skip |
| `JSTests/stress`, every 40th file | flag off | 142 of 143 pass |

GIL off means `JSC_useSharedGCHeap=1 JSC_useThreadGILOffUnsafe=1
JSC_useThreadGIL=0` in the environment.

Every failure in the table also fails, the same way, on a Debug build of
oven-sh/WebKit#549 (the tree before the rebase). So none of them comes from
the rebase, but they still block landing. The one `JSTests/stress` failure
(`re-execute-error-module.js`) is a Bun change to a module error message and
fails on `main` too.

## Part 1: Safety

### 1.1 Known failures

Fix or explain each of these. A test that is wrong is fixed in the test, with
the reason in the commit message. A test that only fails in Debug is still a
bug: an assertion that a race can trip means the code does not hold the
invariant it asserts.

#### Default corpus, GIL off

| Test | Symptom | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `objectmodel/typedarray-view-conversion-vector-length.js` | `BlockDirectory::assertIsMutatorOrMutatorIsStopped` from `MarkedSpace::size()` | A heap walk while other mutators run. |
| `vmstate/regexp-atom-retained-across-delete-all-code.js` | `MarkedSpace::stopAllocating` assertion from `Heap::deleteAllCodeBlocks` | `HeapIterationScope` on the shared heap without a stop-the-world. |
| `jit/call-link-record-pin-dying-caller.js` | Same assertion from `Heap::globalObjectCount` (`$vm.globalObjectCount()`) | Same class as the row above. |
| `jit/osr-entry-must-handle-values-generator-threads.js` | `InternalFunctionAllocationProfile::createAllocationStructureFromBase` assertion, 9 of 16 runs under load | Two threads miss the profile and race to fill it. |

The first three are one class: a `HeapIterationScope` (or a directory walk) on
the shared heap while other clients run. Decide once whether these callers
must stop the world or must not run GIL-off, and apply that to every
`HeapIterationScope` user. `git grep HeapIterationScope` lists them.

#### CVE suite

Timeouts (exit 124) at the runner's 120 s limit, GIL on:
`mc-code-deferred-fire-stale-window`, `mc-df-arraycopy-relabel`,
`mc-df-ta-detach-resize`, `mc-df-ta-sort-inplace`, `mc-df-wasm-compile-race`,
`mc-init-butterfly-grow-slack`, `mc-init-cloned-arguments-specials`,
`mc-init-direct-arguments-override`, `mc-life-wasm-grow-relocate`,
`mc-lock-stop-vs-park`, `mc-spec-timer-capability`, `mc-tear-date-cache`,
`mc-tear-typedarray-detach-grow-shrink`, `mc-val-fire-vs-link`.

First rerun these on a Release build. A test that passes in Release and only
runs out of time in Debug+ASAN needs a smaller iteration count in Debug
builds, not a longer timeout. A test that also hangs in Release
is a deadlock or a lost wakeup: take a backtrace of every thread while it
hangs.

Other failures:

| Test | Mode | Symptom | First step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mc-aint-poll-resume-stale-elided.js` | both | ASAN SEGV | Real crash. Symbolize and find the owner of the address. |
| `mc-df-arraycopy-relabel.js` | GIL off | `RangeError` from `TypedArray.prototype.set` | Decide whether a racing writer may change the source length here. If yes, the test is wrong. If no, the length read is. |
| `mc-life-creator-thread-dies.js` | GIL off | `TypeError: Buffer is already detached` | Find who detaches the buffer when the creating thread exits. |
| `mc-gc-weakgcmap-registry-vs-prune.js` | both | `ReferenceError: $vm is not defined` | The test lacks `//@ requireOptions("--useDollarVM=1")`. |
| `mc-jit-delete-reuse-stale-offset.js`, `mc-jit-double-relabel-stale-shape.js`, `mc-jit-ta-resize-hoisted-base.js` | GIL on | The writer never leaves its `idle` state | These races need the GIL off. Confirm, then mark them GIL-off only. |

Done when both suites pass in Debug and Release, in both modes, with no test
marked expected-fail without a written reason.

### 1.2 Test coverage still missing

Run each of these and file the failures in this document.

- **The full JSC test suites, flag off.** `Tools/Scripts/run-javascriptcore-tests`
  (stress, microbenchmarks, `mozilla`, `test262`), Debug and Release. This is
  the check that the branch changes nothing for code that never sets the
  flag. Compare against `main`, not against an absolute pass count.
- **The same suites with `--useJSThreads=1`, GIL on.** Nothing spawns a
  thread, so every difference from the flag-off run is a bug in a flag-on path
  that single-threaded code takes: tagged butterflies, handler ICs, per-thread
  state.
- **The same suites GIL off.** Same reasoning, for the GIL-off paths.
- **TSAN.** `TSAN.md` describes the build and the triage. Run `JSTests/threads`
  and the CVE suite. Every report is either fixed or listed in
  `TSAN-TRIAGE.md` with the reason it is benign.
- **The amplifier and the fuzzers.** `AMPLIFIER.md` and `FUZZ.md`. Run them
  for hours, not minutes, in both GIL modes.
- **Bun.** Build Bun against this branch and run its test suite with the flag
  off. Then run it with the flag on and no threads. Bun is the first user, and
  it uses `USE(BUN_JSC_ADDITIONS)` paths that the JSC tests do not reach.
- **Other platforms.** macOS arm64, Linux arm64, and Windows x64. arm64 is
  weakly ordered and is where a missing fence shows up. The ARM64 paths
  (address dependencies, TLS loads) have not run at all since the rebase.

### 1.3 Audit upstream code added since the merge base

The rebase brought in about 5,800 upstream commits. Some of them added code
that assumes the old object model, and it compiled without complaint. The
rebase found these cases only because a test happened to reach them:

- `USE(JSVALUE64)` no longer existed, so 280 threads blocks compiled out.
- New data IC slow paths were never emitted from the FTL.
- A new LLInt diagnostic read a property slot before the threads re-read.
- New typed array sorts wrote shared lanes in place.

There are certainly more. Audit the upstream diff since the merge base
(`5851d4722e46..origin/main`) for:

- direct butterfly loads in JIT or LLInt code that do not go through the
  tagged-butterfly helpers,
- new `switch` statements over node types or cache types that the threads
  code extends,
- new `HeapIterationScope` users,
- new caches on the VM or on a cell that a second thread could read,
- new uses of `Options` or macros the threads code changes.

Write the result in a new `AUDIT-upstream-since-rebase.md`, in the same form
as the other `AUDIT-*.md` files.

### 1.4 Review the async generator port

Upstream moved the async generator driver to C++ and made it follow the
current spec. The GIL-off claim from oven-sh/WebKit#249 no longer applied, so
it was ported (commit "Serialize async generator requests across threads when
the GIL is off"). The protocol is described in `JSAsyncGenerator.cpp`. It
needs a review by someone who has not seen it, and a stress test with several
threads calling `next()`, `return()` and `throw()` on one generator.

## Part 2: Performance

The goal, from `THREAD.md` and `BENCH.md`, is unchanged: about zero cost for
single-threaded code when the flag is off. The flag-on cost with no threads
running matters too, because that is what Bun users get once the flag ships.

### 2.1 Baseline

Every comparison below is against `main` at the branch's base commit, built
with the same compiler and flags, on the same machine. Build both trees in
Release with LTO, the way Bun ships. Record the exact commands with the
results.

### 2.2 Benchmarks

| What | Tool | Compare |
|---|---|---|
| Microbenchmarks that stress the changed paths | `Tools/threads/bench-gate.sh` (see `BENCH.md`) | Record the baseline from `main`, then gate the branch, flag off. |
| Whole-engine benchmarks | JetStream 3 and the JSC microbenchmarks, via `Tools/Scripts/run-jsc-benchmarks` | `main`, branch with the flag off, branch with `--useJSThreads=1` |
| Bun | Bun's benchmark suite, and startup time (`bun -e 0`) | Bun built against `main`, and against the branch |
| Memory | Peak RSS on the above, and the size of `JSObject`, `Structure`, `Butterfly` and `VM` | `main` against the branch |
| Binary size | Size of `libJavaScriptCore.a` and of the Bun binary | `main` against the branch |
| Threads | `SCALEBENCH.md`, GIL on and GIL off | Only against the branch itself |

Run each benchmark enough times to report a median and a confidence interval.
Report a slowdown only when the interval does not include zero.

### 2.3 Find where the cost is

A benchmark shows that a slowdown exists. These show where it comes from.

- **Generated code.** Dump the LLInt (`offlineasm` output) and the Baseline,
  DFG and FTL code for a few hot functions, on `main` and on the branch, flag
  off, and diff them. Every flag-off difference needs a reason.
- **Flag checks on hot paths.** Count the `Options::useJSThreads()`,
  `vm.gilOff()` and `g_jscConfig.gilOffProcess` tests on paths that run per
  property access, per allocation, or per call. Each one is a load and a
  branch. Move it off the hot path or into a watchpoint where possible.
- **Atomics.** `JSCJSValue.h` keeps JSValue accesses plain outside TSAN, so
  loops still vectorize. Check that nothing else turned a hot plain access
  into an atomic one, and that no `seq_cst` access appeared on a flag-off path.
- **Layout.** Compare `sizeof` and field offsets of the hot classes. A field
  that moves out of the first cache line costs on every access.
- **Profiles.** Where a benchmark regresses, take a `perf` profile on both
  trees and compare the top functions.

Write the results in a new `PERF-RESULTS.md`, with the commands, the numbers,
and one line of explanation for each difference.

## Order of work

1. Fix the failures that are clearly bugs (1.1). They may hide others.
2. Record the performance baseline and run the bench gate (2.1, 2.2). A design
   change forced by a regression is cheaper to make early.
3. Run the full suites in all three modes (1.2).
4. Do the upstream audit (1.3) and the async generator review (1.4).
5. Run TSAN, the amplifier, the fuzzers, and the other platforms (1.2).
6. Run Bun's tests and benchmarks against the branch (1.2, 2.2).

## Exit criteria

The branch is ready to land when all of these hold:

- `JSTests/threads` and the CVE suite pass in Debug and Release, GIL on and
  GIL off, on Linux x86-64 and on one arm64 platform.
- The JSC test suites give the same results as `main` with the flag off, and
  no new failures with the flag on.
- TSAN reports nothing on `JSTests/threads` that `TSAN-TRIAGE.md` does not
  explain.
- Bun's test suite gives the same results as with `main`.
- No benchmark in 2.2 is slower than `main` with the flag off, beyond noise.
- Every flag-off difference in generated code has a written reason.
